==================
GENERAL
========================

Add MEC's icons. DONE
Add perks icons.
Move all the perk buttons to single grid.

====================
MAINWINDOW
====================

Move json loading and soldier list generation to separate function.

replace index_translation with single int that marks beggining of the soldiers?
soldiers SHOULD be next to each other in the save file.
this would mess with potential sorting/search later on.


=======================
UTILS
======================

is it more efficient to pull whole upgrades array, or read single entries form json?
yeah, thats need a change.
