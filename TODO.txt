Try to load just the header while loading save descriptions.
Rewrite app so it doesnt use json, just xcom_save. (if possible?)
Remove option to unassign a perk, or randomly decrease stats (would be exploitable).
Add random stats lvlup after assigning fresh perks.
Add Vanilla XCOM support.


=============================

Perks connected to items for some reason have values different than 1/0 (Needs more testing)
Value can be greater than 0 even when perk isnt selected.
Other perks can increase its value?

sooo, uneven means the perk is actually selected, and every item that is in eq is just 2x


Index 22 - Shredder Ammo

Having shreeder rocket without perk in the inventory sets the value to 2?
Having Perk without shderred rocket in eq sets value to 1
Having Both sets value to 3.

So 1 or 3 indicates perk?

Index 8 - Battle scanner

NO NADE IN EQ
1 - despite having packaster 

1 NADE IN EQ
2 - both smoke nad mirrors and packamster
3 - packmaster and scanner


Index 44 - smoke grenade

NO NADES IN EQ
1 - Smoke Greande Perk (along with both others)
0 - No Smoke Grenade Perk (no matter the others)

1 NADE IN EQ
3 - Smoke Grenade Perk (along with both others)
2 - Smoke and Mirrors (none of the others)
2 - Smoke and Mirorrs/Packmaster
2 - Fresh Engineer, no perks at all.
2 - ONLY Packmaster.
3 - SMoke Grenade AND packmaster.
3 - SMOKE GRENADE AND SMOKE & MIRRORS

2 NADE IN EQ
4 - Somke and Mirros
4 - Smoke and mirros and packmaster
5 - first 2
5 - all 3
5 - just first













5-all 3 skills and 2x nade in eq

- depends on the items equiped.
- represents how many extra smokes soldier can throw based on abilites?
//- can be 0 if no smoke grenades are equiped.
- can be > 0 even whenever another perk is selected.
- how does the game know if perk should be highlighted or not? or when to apply 2nd part of the perk during battle.

Index represents how many extra uses of said item you get from your abilites based on your inventory?
or the amout of smokes that should be displayed in the inventory tab? (needs testing)


Smoke Grenade + 1 
Smoke & Mirrors + 1 (so SMoke & Mirros dont give you extra item, it increases charges of that perk granted item? this way packmaster only works once)
Packmaster + 1 (shouldnt be +2 since both smoke grenade and smoke & mirrors give you 1 nade?)

Assuming no Smoke grenades in the EQ:
index = 0 (smoke grenades in eq)
if (Somke Grenade): index + 1
if (Smoke Grenade AND Smoke and mirrors) index + 1


value is 1 with no nades equiped and all 3 abilites. maybe this is the way?

Assuming ONE Smoke Grenades in the EQ:
index = 1 (smoke grenades in eq)
if (smoke Greande): index + 1
if (SMoke and mirrors) 



NOT CONFIRMED:
Field Medic
Fire Rocket
Grenadier?
Packmaster
Repair
Savior
Shock & Awe
Smoke & Mirrors









Soldier Class is needed if we want to avoid live edits.

Soldier should store pointer to property_list of soldier
