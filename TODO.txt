Try to load just the header while loading save descriptions.
Rewrite app so it doesnt use json, just xcom_save. (if possible?)
Remove option to unassign a perk, or randomly decrease stats (would be exploitable).
Add random stats lvlup after assigning fresh perks.
Add Vanilla XCOM support.


=============================

Perks connected to items for some reason have values different than 1/0 (Needs more testing)
Value can be greater than 0 even when perk isnt selected.
Other perks can increase its value?

Index 22 - Shredder Ammo
Index 8 - Battle scanner


Index 44 - smoke grenade
- depends on the items equiped.
- represents how many extra smokes soldier can throw based on abilites?
- can be 0 if no smoke grenades are equiped.
- can be > 0 even whenever another perk is selected.
- how does the game know if perk should be highlighted or not? or when to apply 2nd part of the perk during battle.

Index represents how many extra uses of said item you get from your abilites based on your inventory?
or the amout of smokes that should be displayed in the inventory tab? (needs testing)


Smoke Grenade + 1 
Smoke & Mirrors + 1 (so SMoke & Mirros dont give you extra item, it increases charges of that perk granted item? this way packmaster only works once)
Packmaster + 1 (shouldnt be +2 since both smoke grenade and smoke & mirrors give you 1 nade?)

Assuming no Smoke grenades in the EQ:
index = 0 (smoke grenades in eq)
if (Somke Grenade): index + 1
if (Smoke Grenade AND Smoke and mirrors) index + 1
if (Smoke Grenade AND Packmaster) index + 1

Assuming ONE Smoke Grenades in the EQ:
index = 1 (smoke grenades in eq)
if (smoke Greande): index + 1
if (SMoke and mirrors)
